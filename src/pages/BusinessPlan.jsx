    content: `Dyson & Dyson Concierge Relocation Services is a fully independent relocation management company — not a brokerage, not an agent network, not a listing service. We manage the entire relocation experience for families moving across the country, from first question to final walkthrough. The service is 100% free to buyers. Always.

THE LEGACY:
Founded by Bob Dyson — builder of Red Carpet Corporation of America, growing it from 500 to 1,600+ offices with 45,000 agents across 42 states. Bob served as Chief Pilot for the Governor of Oklahoma and has operated at every level of real estate for 54+ years. We use this legacy of scale to vet every local agent we partner with today. That credibility is irreplaceable and not reproducible by any tech company.

Market Opportunity: 8–9 million households relocate annually in the US. The relocation market is fragmented and painful — consumers coordinate real estate agents, movers, utilities, schools, and healthcare across multiple vendors with no central guide. Dyson consolidates this into one managed experience.

The Dyson Philosophy: We intentionally work with a limited number of families at any given time. This is not exclusivity for its own sake — it is a commitment to quality. Real relocation management demands intensive focus, deep local knowledge, timeline coordination, and relentless attention to detail. We are not scaling a service. We are delivering one.

Business Model: Free-to-consumer, agent-funded revenue:
• 25% referral fee on buyer-side commission (from receiving agent at close)
• 10–15% relocation management fee (from seller at close of their current home)
• Both fees disclosed transparently upfront — zero surprises

WHAT CHARLIE DOES FOR EVERY CLIENT:
• Neighborhood Research: AI-powered analysis matched to lifestyle, commute, schools, safety, community
• 24/7 AI Concierge: Charlie answers every question about the new city, anytime, at no cost
• Agent Selection: Charlie interviews the client on agent personality fit, then we evaluate the top 20 agents in the destination market — DRE ratings, production records, personality screened by Bob Dyson personally. We present 3–5 curated candidates. Client chooses. No "I love me" agents chasing a deal.
• Moving Logistics: From packing to delivery — Charlie manages the entire moving checklist
• Utilities & Services: Internet, electric, gas, water — all transferred and set up before arrival
• School Enrollment: District research, school tours, enrollment paperwork
• Healthcare Setup: Top-rated doctors, dentists, and specialists in the new area
• Zero Cost to Buyers: Completely free — always

THE GEMINI SESSION — BY INVITATION ONLY:
After a client confirms their information, we schedule a private 3-way live session:
• The client and their family
• Google Gemini AI — one of the most advanced AI systems in the world
• Bob Dyson — 40+ years of hands-on real estate expertise

In this session we build the complete relocation profile together, in real time. It is not a chatbot form. It is a real conversation. This session is by invitation only — we are selective about who we work with to ensure everyone gets the intensive, hands-on attention they deserve.

THE CLIENT DASHBOARD:
Every client gets a personalized dashboard showing their full moving timeline, matched listings, completed/pending tasks, Charlie chat history, neighborhood research, and offer/escrow status. Everything in one place, on any device.`

    content: `DNN BROADCAST ASSEMBLY LINE — STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
  ════════════════════════════════════════════════

  This is the canonical playbook for producing and distributing a DNN daily broadcast.
  Follow these steps in exact order. Do NOT skip or reorder.

  ────────────────────────────────
  STAGE 1: SECURE THE GOLDEN MASTER LAYOUT
  ────────────────────────────────
  • Open Admin → DNN Studio → Layout Library
  • Confirm the "DNN Master Base Layout" template has status = "approved"
  • This template holds: avatar IDs, voice IDs, presenter positions, solution panel
    dimensions, background image, and video output dimensions
  • dnnStitchBroadcast pulls from this template on every render — never override

  ────────────────────────────────
  STAGE 2: GENERATE SCRIPTS
  ────────────────────────────────
  • Scripts live on the DnnBroadcast record's clips[] array
  • Each clip has: role (charlie|bob), script (spoken text), question (title)
  • Use phonetic domain normalization: "1dnn.com" → "One D N N dot com" in spoken audio
  • Scripts are distinct from layout — treat them as interchangeable modules

  ────────────────────────────────
  STAGE 3: RENDER RAW CLIPS (HeyGen)
  ────────────────────────────────
  • Trigger via Admin → Show Pipeline → "Render" button
  • Backend function: dnnStitchBroadcast (action: "start")
  • HeyGen generates raw talking-head clips on black background, one per clip
  • No studio backdrop, no composition, no background baking at the server level
  • Status transitions: draft → script_ready → rendering → completed

  ────────────────────────────────
  STAGE 4: RE-UPLOAD TO PERMANENT STORAGE
  ────────────────────────────────
  • HeyGen CDN URLs expire — MUST re-upload to permanent Base44 storage
  • Backend function: reuploadShow5Clips (or equivalent per show number)
  • This function: downloads each HeyGen MP4, uploads to Base44, updates clips[].videoUrl
  • Without this step, clips will fail to play after ~24 hours

  ────────────────────────────────
  STAGE 5: COMPOSITE IN BROWSER (Studio Preview)
  ────────────────────────────────
  • The DnnNewsBroadcastPlayer.jsx handles ALL visual composition in the browser
  • Studio backdrop image, Charlie slot (bottom-left), Bob slot (bottom-right)
  • Solution panel overlay with bullet points
  • Navigation pills (News, Relocation, Intelligence) at bottom of screen
  • Single-play broadcast flow — hard terminal exit to /?choose=1

  ───────────────────────────────────────────
  STAGE 6: DISTRIBUTION — LINKEDIN POSTING RECIPE
  ───────────────────────────────────────────
  • Backend function: postToLinkedInV2
  • Posts to the DNN organization page (LinkedIn company page, not personal)

  POST STRUCTURE (the established recipe):
  ───────────────────────────────────────────
  TEXT BODY (appears ABOVE the video thumbnail):

    📡 DNN Intelligence Bureau

    {headline from broadcast}

    Charlie Simmons and Bob Dyson break down today's top
    relocation and real estate intelligence.

    🔔 Watch the full broadcast: https://1dnn.com/dnn-news?autoplay=1
    Subscribe for free: https://1dnn.com/subscribe

  VIDEO THUMBNAIL: The broadcast MP4 itself (uploaded via LinkedIn Videos API)
  TITLE: The first headline from the broadcast
  DESCRIPTION: "Charlie Simmons and Bob Dyson break down today's top relocation
               and real estate intelligence."
  POSTED TO: DNN organization page

  CRITICAL: The link to the live show (https://1dnn.com/dnn-news?autoplay=1) goes
  in the description text ABOVE the thumbnail — this is where viewers click through
  to watch the full broadcast on the site.

  RENDER GUARD: postToLinkedInV2 checks broadcast.needsReRender before posting.
  If stale, it returns 409 and the frontend triggers a re-render first.

  ────────────────────────────────────
  STAGE 7: OTHER DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS
  ────────────────────────────────────
  • Facebook: postBroadcastToFacebook function
  • Subscriber Email: dnnMorningEmailBlast function
  • Agent Private-Label: AgentShowDistribution (per-agent branded distribution)
  • Instagram: Instagram Business connector (requires additional setup)

  ────────────────────────────────────
  CONTENT HASH DEDUPLICATION
  ────────────────────────────────────
  • Each broadcast has a layoutHash (SHA-256 of scripts + clips + layout constants)
  • renderHistory is an immutable ledger of hash → videoUrl mappings
  • If content reverts to a previous state, the cached MP4 is served without
    burning a new HeyGen credit
  • affiliate_overlays (logo, agent name, market city) are NOT included in layoutHash
    — swapping affiliate branding never triggers a golden master re-render`

    content: `Primary Revenue Stream: Agent Referral Fees
• 25% referral fee on buyer-side commission (when referred buyer closes)
• 15% relocation management fee for our coordination services
• Revenue scales with transaction volume and average home price

Secondary Opportunities:
• Corporate relocation partnerships (provide concierge for employee relocations)
• International relocation (expand beyond US)
• Rental market expansion (renters also relocate; lower AOV but high volume)
• Data licensing (anonymized buyer intent, neighborhood sentiment, agent performance)
• Insurance partnerships (home, auto, life—relocating families need all three)

Unit Economics: Higher-priced markets (Austin, Denver, Seattle, Florida) generate larger referral fees. Focus growth in high-value markets first.`

    content: `1. Bob Dyson's 40+ Year Track Record: This is not a startup guessing at real estate. Bob built and sold a 1,600-office, 45,000-agent network. He has operated at every level of this industry. That credibility is irreplaceable and not reproducible by a tech company.

2. The Human + AI Model: We don't choose between technology and expertise — we combine them. AI provides speed, scale, and 24/7 availability. Bob and our team provide judgment, trust, and accountability. Every major recommendation is reviewed by a human expert before reaching the client. No competitor is doing this at this level.

3. Intentionally Limited Intake: We do not race to scale. We work with a limited number of clients at any time because we refuse to compromise on quality. This creates a sense of invitation and exclusivity that premium clients respond to.

4. Listing Agent Partnership Model: We turn every listing agent into a referral partner. At their listing presentation, they can offer a complete concierge relocation service to their sellers — at zero cost to the agent or seller. They earn 25% at close. We handle everything.

5. The Presentation Library: All agent-facing, client-facing, and receiving-agent materials are stored, versioned, and deliverable from a central admin hub.

6. Communication Threading: Every SMS and email with clients and agents is logged, searchable, and threaded in the admin panel. Full conversation history. No context is ever lost.

7. Data Moat: PropStream property data, CrissCross skip trace, Google Gemini web search, and growing transaction history create a defensible intelligence layer no individual agent can replicate.

8. End-to-End Integration: Competitors solve one problem. We solve the entire journey — agent, city, move, utilities, schools, healthcare, and beyond.

9. Luxury Positioning: Premium brand design and Bob's direct personal engagement position Dyson above commoditized platforms (Zillow, Redfin).`

1. DATA AGGREGATION via PropStream
Log into PropStream, search active listings by city/zip/price range, and export the MLS list. This file has addresses and prices — but NO phone numbers yet. Do NOT import into Base44 at this stage.

2. SKIP TRACING for Direct Contact
Run SkipTrace on your MLS list inside PropStream (~$0.10–$0.15/record). Download the SkipTrace Export — it contains Owner Name, Cell Phone 1, Cell Phone 2, Property Address. THIS is the file you import into Base44.

3. BASE44 CRM INTEGRATION
In Admin → Listing Owners → Import CSV. Select your SkipTrace file. Preview confirms owner names, phone formatting, address presence. Click "Import X Owners." All contacts enter the system as: not_contacted.

4. TWILIO / SMS MULTI-PHASE OUTREACH (Phase 1–7)
• Phase 1 — Get list from PropStream MLS
• Phase 2 — Run SkipTrace in PropStream
• Phase 3 — Import SkipTrace into Base44
• Phase 4 — Send campaign via Admin → Compose SMS
• Phase 5 — Monitor replies automatically: STOP → opt_out, YES → opt_in, other → in_conversation
• Phase 6 — Day 3 and Day 7 follow-up sends
• Phase 7 — Track everything: Batch SMS Logs, Outreach Pipeline, New Opt-Ins, Active Campaigns

5. GMAIL AUTO-REPLY TRACKING
Bob's Gmail is monitored in real-time for replies matching an owner's email. YES → interested. STOP → OptOut table. All other replies → in_conversation with content saved to notes.

────────────────────────────────
📅 MAY 18, 2026 — PLATFORM DECISIONS LOG
────────────────────────────────

DECISION 1 — TWILIO: FULLY RETAINED (NO CHANGES)
Twilio remains the backbone of all automated SMS operations:
• Bulk homeowner outreach (skip-trace → batch send)
• Day 3 / Day 7 automated follow-ups
• Inbound reply processing (STOP → opt-out, YES → opt-in, other → in_conversation)
• Client SMS notifications
• All Twilio webhook handlers remain active and unchanged
Reason: Twilio is infrastructure — deeply integrated and working. The complexity of replacement far exceeds any benefit at this stage.

DECISION 2 — SIMPLETEXTING.COM: REINSTATED FOR AGENT CAMPAIGN ONLY
SimpleTexting.com is reinstated exclusively for the Top 200 Independent Agent outreach campaign.
• Operated manually outside the Base44 app — no API integration at this time
• Used for high-touch, 1-on-1 conversational outreach (not bulk blasting)
• Agents are managed directly in the SimpleTexting inbox by Bob / admin staff
• Responses are manually logged back into the VettedPartner entity in Base44
• Future: If agent campaign scales, evaluate SimpleTexting API integration at that time

DECISION 3 — GEMINI 3.1 FLASH LIVE: DEPLOYMENT BEGINS POST-MAY 19
Post-Google I/O (May 19, 2026), the Gemini 3.1 Flash Live API deployment begins:
• Voice-to-text (current) upgrades to full voice-to-voice (native audio stream)
• ElevenLabs permanently removed from consideration — all voice is native Gemini
• Bob Dyson voice clone deployment begins on Google Native Voice Clone GA
• Charlie's voice layer upgrades to Bob's clone — rename announcement to follow

────────────────────────────────
PHASE EXPANSION ROADMAP
────────────────────────────────

Phase 1 — NOW: Charlie live 24/7, Gemini Session pipeline operational, Admin panel fully active, Listing Agent outreach running.

Phase 2 (Months 3–9): Recruit agents in Austin, Denver, Charlotte, Nashville, Phoenix. Launch Receiving Agent network.

Phase 3 (Months 9–18): Scale intake, corporate relocation partnerships, Delta Report automation.

Phase 4 (Year 2+): Canada, UK, Mexico expansion. Rental product, insurance partnerships, investment syndication.

THE FLYWHEEL:
One family → two potential transactions (buy + sell) → two referral fees → agent refers next client → more families → better data → better matches → more families.`

The Goal:
Position Bob Dyson as the "Oracle of Relocation" by leveraging his 54-year industry legacy. No competitor can match this combination of scale, longevity, and current AI adoption.

Content Pillars:
1. "Then vs. Now" — Historic vs. modern real estate comparisons. Side-by-side snapshots of what buying a home looked like in 1972, 1995, 2010, and today.

2. "AI Charlie" Spotlights — Showcasing the precision of the relocation engine. Short-form demos of Charlie in action: answering neighborhood questions, comparing schools, walking a buyer through the commitment gate.

3. "The 1927 Parallel" — Authority deep dives. The signature series connecting the invention of synchronized sound in film to the emergence of voice-to-voice AI in real estate.

Posting Frequency:
3x weekly high-authority posts on LinkedIn and Instagram. Consistent 90-day cadence builds algorithmic momentum and audience trust before any paid amplification.

Call to Action:
Every post directs users to the Gold Pill search bar — "Considering a move? Where are you going?" — to start their custom relocation roadmap.

Platform Notes:
• LinkedIn: Long-form authority content targeting listing agents, corporate HR relocation coordinators, and real estate professionals.
• Instagram: Visual storytelling — then/now photos, Charlie clips, neighborhood reels.
• Engagement: Every comment replied to within 24 hours. Every DM from a relocating family routed to Charlie intake.`

🔔 GOOGLE GEMINI I/O — MAY 19, 2026 UPDATE
────────────────────────────────
Google's Gemini I/O announcement on May 19, 2026 opens the door to full Gemini 3.1 Flash Live API deployment.

CURRENT STATE (Pre-May 19):
• Charlie currently uses Gemini for voice-to-TEXT — the user speaks, Gemini transcribes and generates a text response. This is the existing charlieVoiceChat / charlieSpeak pipeline already live in the app.

NEXT STATE (Post-May 19 — Gemini 3.1 Flash Live):
• Full voice-to-VOICE — the user speaks, Gemini responds with a real-time native audio stream. No transcription step, no text-to-speech step. A true continuous voice conversation.
• This is the upgrade path: same Gemini API key, same Base44 backend, new Live API WebSocket endpoint.
• Latency drops dramatically. Conversation feels natural and uninterrupted.
• This is the foundation for the Two-Character Interview Format (Journalist + Bob Clone) documented in the Dyson Media Desk section.

MIGRATION PLAN:
1. Monitor Google I/O May 19 announcement for Gemini 3.1 Flash Live GA availability
2. Update geminiLiveProxy backend function to use the new Live API WebSocket endpoint
3. Test voice-to-voice flow with a single Charlie session
4. Roll out to full client intake pipeline
5. Activate Two-Character Interview format for DNN media production

Infrastructure Priorities:
1. Scale LLM inference (caching common queries, batch processing)
2. Build MLS aggregation layer (reduce Zillow dependency)
3. Public data warehouse (Census, schools, healthcare)
4. Real-time notification system (new listings, agent responses)
5. Analytics & BI platform (agent performance, user behavior)

Cost Optimization: As volume grows, replace Gemini API calls with cached responses and custom fine-tuned models.`

    content: `WELCOME TO DYSON & DYSON — HOW THE MACHINE WORKS

STEP 1 — CLIENT ACQUISITION (Automated)
Clients come in two ways:
A) Inbound via Website / App — potential relocating family visits dysonanddyson.com, interacts with Charlie, and either chats or books a live Gemini session.
B) Outbound Seller Outreach — we identify homeowners listing their homes, run skip tracing to get phone numbers, send outreach SMS via Twilio.

STEP 2 — COMMITMENT GATE (Automated)
Before a client gets access to the deep AI interview, they must pass through our Commitment Gate:
1. Intro + Disclosure
2. Contact Form — captures name, email, phone
3. Service Agreement — 5 checkboxes the client must personally confirm

STEP 3 — GEMINI LIVE INTAKE SESSION (Automated)
After the gate, the client enters a live voice-to-voice AI interview powered by Google Gemini. Lasts 10–20 minutes. Fully transcribed in real-time.

STEP 4 — AUTOMATED DEBRIEF (Automated)
When the session ends, Gemini analyzes the full transcript and extracts structured data. Saved to RelocationClient profile, converted into RelocationTask records, flagged for staff review.

STEP 5 — STAFF REVIEW & AGENT MATCHING (Human)
THIS IS WHERE YOU COME IN. After the automated steps, a staff member reviews the new profile, reads the AI-generated summary, and selects the best agent match.

STEP 6 — AGENT MATCHING & AGREEMENT (Human + Automated)
ReferralProposal created → agent receives email with accept/reject link → agent accepts → digital agreement executed → agent introduced to client.

STEP 7 — ACTIVE RELOCATION & CHARLIE SUPPORT (Automated + Human)
Charlie continues to serve the client 24/7. RelocationTasks tracked and updated. Staff spot-checks flagged conversations.

STEP 8 — CLOSE & GET PAID (Human)
Verify referral fee triggered → confirm close date → invoice receiving broker → mark fees_paid = true → follow up for NPS survey.

CYCLE COMPLETE. One family, two potential transactions (buy + sell). That's the full flywheel.`

SCREEN 1: Intro & Disclosure
Shows the client what Gemini AI is, that the session is recorded, that their profile is reviewed by human Dyson staff, and that the service is 100% free to them.

SCREEN 2: Contact Form
Captures: Full name, email address, phone (optional)

SCREEN 3: Service Agreement (The 5 Commitments)
1. "Service is free to me — agents handle compensation"
2. "I will work exclusively with a Dyson-referred agent for my destination purchase" → THIS IS YOUR PROTECTION.
3. "I consent to this conversation being recorded and summarized"
4. "My profile will be reviewed by Dyson staff to match me with the right agent"
5. "All official transaction communications will flow through the Dyson platform"

WHY THE GATE IS NON-NEGOTIABLE:
Without the gate, you can spend 20 minutes matching a client with an agent, they close 6 months later, and the agent claims they found the buyer themselves. With the gate you have timestamped, documented agreement + proof of exclusive representation + legal basis for the referral fee claim.

Never skip the gate. Never "let someone start the session early." The gate IS the contract.`

WHAT TRIGGERS THE DEBRIEF:
When a client clicks "End Session & Build Profile," the full transcript is sent to the geminiDebrief backend function. Gemini 2.5 Flash analyzes it and extracts structured JSON data saved to multiple entities simultaneously.

WHAT GEMINI EXTRACTS:
• destination_city, current_city, move_timeline
• family_size, family_details (kids' ages, pets, special needs)
• budget_range, purchase_type (buying vs. renting)
• priorities array mapped from conversational language to standard tags
• employment situation
• selling_current_home (true/false — potential second transaction!)
• action_items — every specific task they mention
• summary — 2-3 sentence human-readable summary for the matching agent

WHERE THE DATA GOES:
1. RelocationClient entity — profile created or updated
2. RelocationTask entity — one task per action item, auto-categorized
3. ChatMessage entity — full transcript saved verbatim
4. ChatMessage entity (second) — admin alert flagged for review

HOW TO READ A DEBRIEF AS STAFF:
In AdminClients panel: find new client → read notes (AI summary) → check priorities array → look for selling_current_home = true → check agent_personality_match notes → review action items in RelocationTasks.

THE DEBRIEF IS YOUR BRIEFING DOCUMENT. Before you pick up the phone or send a single email about this client, read their debrief.`

    content: `THE LISTING AGENT DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL — HOW WE GROW WITHOUT ADVERTISING

THE AGENT'S ROLE:
The listing agent does ONE thing: at their listing presentation, they say:
"I've partnered with Dyson & Dyson to offer you a complete concierge relocation service — at zero cost to you."

That's it. They hand the seller to us. We do everything else.

WHAT THE AGENT GETS:
• 25% referral fee at close of the buyer's new home
• Zero added workload — we handle 100% of the relocation
• Transaction portal access: read-only visibility into the client's move milestones
• Their client comes back after the move and refers them friends

THE PRESENTATION LIBRARY:
1. Listing Agent Partnership Presentation (8 slides)
2. Client Welcome & Relocation Overview (8 slides)
3. Receiving Agent Program (in development)
4. AI Explainer: The 1927 Parallel (4 slides)

THE AGENT FEE STRUCTURE:
Example on a $600,000 new home:
• Buyer's agent commission: 2.5% = $15,000
• Agent's 25% referral share = $3,750 paid at close
• Our relocation management fee: 10–15% from seller at close of THEIR home

The agent earns $3,750 by saying one sentence at a listing appointment. That's the pitch.`

    content: `THE INTERVIEW GATE — QUALITY CONTROL BEFORE AGENT MATCHING

WHY THE INTERVIEW EXISTS:
Bob Dyson interviews every client personally (or reviews their Gemini session transcript) before any agent is introduced:
1. QUALITY PROTECTION: We vouch for every client we send to an agent.
2. CAPACITY MANAGEMENT: We work with a limited number of families at any time.
3. FEE PROTECTION: A serious, committed client is far more likely to close.

THE INTERVIEW WORKFLOW:
STEP 1: Client completes Gemini Session → Profile auto-created → Interview record created with status "pending"
STEP 2: Admin schedules interview → Client notified
STEP 3: Bob or team conducts interview → Notes recorded → Status updated to "completed"
STEP 4: Approval decision → APPROVED: Client advances to agent matching. REJECTED: Client notified gracefully.

WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR:
• Clear destination city and timeline (not "maybe someday")
• Financial readiness (pre-qualified or strong buyer signals)
• Family engagement — both decision-makers involved
• Genuine relocation (not fishing for free information)
• Willingness to work exclusively with our referred agent

    content: `THE THIRD PILLAR STRATEGY — FROM CONCIERGE TO MEDIA ENTITY

Dyson & Dyson does not just manage relocations. We have repositioned as a broadcast intelligence network that serves the consumer daily — not just during a transaction. DNN (Digital News Network) is that daily touchpoint.

────────────────────────────────
WHY A NEWS NETWORK?
────────────────────────────────
Most real estate companies only have permission to contact a consumer when they're in a transaction. We want daily permission. DNN gives us that. When we deliver market-moving news daily, we build a subscriber audience that trusts us BEFORE they decide to move. That trust converts to leads, and those leads convert to referral fees.

────────────────────────────────
THE THREE PILLARS
────────────────────────────────

PILLAR 1: RELOCATION INTELLIGENCE (Consumer-Facing)
• DNN delivers AI-generated relocation market briefs daily
• Topics: interest rates, migration data, housing markets, tax policy, employer moves
• Subscribers receive these via email (Communications Hub blast) and in-app (DNN News Feed)
• Charlie is the bridge — every article ends with "Ask Charlie About This"
• Strategy: Educate the consumer into understanding that they need to relocate — then be the obvious solution

PILLAR 2: AGENT BUREAU (B2B Revenue)
• Partner agents ("Bureau Chiefs") pay to receive co-branded DNN intelligence for their farm
• Each Bureau Chief gets exclusive territory rights in their market
• DNN wraps our articles with "Intelligence brought to you by DNN in partnership with [Agent Name]"
• Bureau Chiefs get a subscriber silo — their clients get DNN content, but the agent gets the co-brand
• Revenue: monthly subscription per Bureau slot + 25% referral fee at close
• This turns our content into a B2B lead engine

PILLAR 3: FINANCIAL SERVICES NETWORK (Coming Q3 2026)
• Vetted lender network in each destination market
• DRE-compliant introductions — we never steer or recommend without disclosure
• Lenders pay a monthly subscription to be DNN-approved
• White-labeled rate intelligence: lender delivers our market briefs co-branded with their credentials
• Revenue: lender subscription + potential referral arrangement (structured for DRE compliance)

────────────────────────────────
THE SUBSCRIBER FLYWHEEL
────────────────────────────────
Homeowner lists (PropStream + SkipTrace)
  → SMS outreach → interested owners opt in
    → Owners become DNN Subscribers (Tier 1)
      → Daily intelligence builds trust
        → When they're ready to list, they call us first
          → Listing agent introduces Dyson concierge to their buyer
            → Buyer becomes a relocation client
              → Referral fee at close
                → Agent becomes a Bureau Chief

ONE HOMEOWNER → SUBSCRIBER → CLIENT → REVENUE → AGENT → MORE SUBSCRIBERS

────────────────────────────────
CHARLIE'S ROLE IN THE DNN NETWORK
────────────────────────────────
Charlie is the editorial voice of DNN from the consumer side. Every subscriber who reads a market brief and has a question gets routed to Charlie. Charlie's job in this context:
• Explain the news in plain language ("What does this rate hike mean for my Austin move?")
• Anchor the consumer to their specific relocation scenario
• Escalate to human staff when a consumer shows high intent
• Feed escalations into the CharlieKnowledgeBase for future training

This creates a closed loop: DNN creates content → Charlie absorbs it → consumers ask questions → Charlie learns from escalations → better responses next cycle.

────────────────────────────────
SUBSCRIBER TIERS
────────────────────────────────
Tier 1 (Free): DNN Intelligence Briefs via email + in-app. No agent assignment.
Tier 2 (Paid, future): Premium market data, early access to agent matching.
Tier 3 (VIP / Agent): Bureau Chief agents and their tagged client networks. Full co-brand.

────────────────────────────────
COMMUNICATIONS HUB WORKFLOW
────────────────────────────────
1. Admin generates DNN article (AI-assisted, reviewed by staff)
2. Article staged → reviewed → published to in-app feed
3. Admin uses Communications Hub to blast the article to subscriber list by tier
4. Blast record saved: blast_count, blasted_at, target_tier
5. Subscriber engagement tracked: opens, clicks, escalations to Charlie
6. High-engagement subscribers flagged as hot leads → routed to relocation intake`

    title: '🏠 Landing Page Transition Plan',
    icon: Globe,
    content: `LANDING PAGE ECOSYSTEM — SEAMLESS TRANSITION STRATEGY
(Updated: April 2026)

THE GOAL:
Replace the current client landing page with the new AdminNewLandingPage design seamlessly — only after every link, sidebar entry, supporting content, and Charlie response is fully coordinated and tested.

────────────────────────────────
WHAT THE NEW LANDING PAGE DOES
────────────────────────────────
The new landing page (H.O.M.E. — Home Ownership Management Ecosystem) serves as the primary consumer entry point with:
• Gold pill search bar: "What is your real estate situation?" with Quick Start shortcuts
• Windean Stratton case study: A long-form proof-of-concept demonstrating our 4-state relocation management capability
• "Your Story Is Next" CTA block: Links to the Solve My Story intake page
• DNN Morning Brief corner card: Live latest article from published DNN feed
• Dark header (Dyson logo + H.O.M.E. title) / Warm tan content area (#ede0cc)

────────────────────────────────
SOLVE MY STORY — INTAKE FLOW
────────────────────────────────
The "Solve My Story" button links to /solve-my-story — a standalone intake page where a prospective client can:
1. Provide full name, email, and phone
2. Select their situation type from a curated list
3. Write their story in detail
4. Submit — which saves them as a hot DnnSubscriber lead AND emails the Dyson team immediately

This is the bridge between marketing content and the CRM.

────────────────────────────────
WHAT MUST BE READY BEFORE WE FLIP THE SWITCH
────────────────────────────────
CLIENT EXPERIENCE (Priority 1):
□ Sidebar links all verified and working
□ Charlie KB trained on all primary client questions
□ DNN news articles published and displaying on landing page card
□ Solve My Story form tested end-to-end (submission → email → CRM entry)
□ Chat/Communications Hub accessible and tested
□ Relocation intake flow (commitment gate → Gemini session → debrief) fully operational

AGENT & LENDER PORTALS (Phase 2 — not blocking launch):
□ Agent Bureau enrollment page
□ Lender network portal (Financial Services — Q3 2026)

────────────────────────────────
QUICK STARTS ON THE LANDING PAGE
────────────────────────────────
• "I'm moving and need a plan." → /relocation-intake (Relo Prong)
• "I'm stuck in a deal." → /chat (Story-Solving / Escrow)
• "I'm an Agent or Lender." → /find-agent (Enterprise Portal)

────────────────────────────────
CHARLIE'S ROLE ON THE NEW LANDING PAGE
────────────────────────────────
Charlie (via FloatingCharlie) is present on the landing page and trained to:
• Answer questions about DNN news and direct to /dnn-news
• Explain the H.O.M.E. ecosystem and Dyson services
• Route clients to the correct Quick Start
• Capture escalations when questions exceed KB coverage
• Funnel hot leads into relocation intake

All new Q&A pairs developed during landing page testing are saved to CharlieKnowledgeBase for permanent training.`,

    icon: Mic,
    content: `ENTRY DATE: May 18, 2026

VIDEO/AUDIO CLONE DEPLOYMENT — THE NEXT PHASE
────────────────────────────────

DECISION: After Google I/O (May 19, 2026), we begin building and refining two clones:

CLONE 1 — THE NEWS PRESENTER ("The Journalist")
• A distinct AI persona — professional broadcast journalist character
• Voice: Gemini 3.1 Flash Live native voice (pre-built, e.g. "Puck" or "Charon")
• Visual: AI-generated video avatar via HeyGen — consistent anchor appearance across all DNN content
• Role: Delivers the daily DNN news briefing in video format
• Deployed: Next to the scripted copy of every news article in the consumer-facing DNN feed

CLONE 2 — BOB DYSON PERSONAL CLONE
• Bob's personal voice + likeness clone (Google Native Voice Clone + HeyGen avatar)
• Role: Delivers "Visionary Insight" commentary on key national real estate and relocation market stories
• Appears alongside The Journalist in the Two-Character Interview format
• Also deployed: On the consumer-facing news feed next to scripted article copy

────────────────────────────────
WHERE THE VIDEO CLONES APPEAR IN THE APP
────────────────────────────────
• DNN News Feed (consumer-facing): Each published article shows a video player with the clone delivering the story, beside the written article text. Consumer gets both formats — read it or watch it.
• Social Distribution: Same video auto-distributed to LinkedIn, Instagram, YouTube via Make.com automation
• Press / VNR: Video formatted as a Video News Release for media outreach

────────────────────────────────
CHARLIE — KEPT, UPDATED, AND RENAMED
────────────────────────────────
DECISION: Charlie is NOT being retired. He is being evolved.

CURRENT STATE: Charlie = text + voice-to-text AI concierge (Gemini Flash)
NEXT STATE: Charlie's voice layer is upgraded to use the Bob Dyson personal voice clone for ALL voice-to-voice responses across ALL categories (relocation intake, city guide, escrow support, agent matching, etc.)

This means:
• Consumers will hear Bob Dyson's voice when talking to the AI concierge
• Charlie's intelligence and knowledge base remain intact — only the voice changes
• Charlie will be RENAMED to reflect the upgrade (name TBD — options: "Bob", "Dyson", "The Advisor", "Your Concierge")
• The rename is a brand moment — announced as an upgrade, not a replacement

MIGRATION SEQUENCE:
1. ✅ DNN content keeps running (no cost, no disruption)
2. Post-May 19: Build Journalist clone + Bob clone using Gemini 3.1 Flash Live
3. QA clones until satisfactory — test on internal DNN articles first
4. Deploy video player to DNN news feed (article page + consumer app)
5. Once clones are approved → swap Charlie's voice layer to Bob clone
6. Rename Charlie → announce to users as a premium upgrade
7. Full rollout: Bob's voice responds to every consumer on every category

────────────────────────────────
WHAT STAYS THE SAME
────────────────────────────────
• DNN Daily Article automation — continues running (free, Gemini-only)
• DNN Morning Brief automation — continues running
• Charlie's knowledge base, scripts, escalation logic — all preserved
• All existing relocation intake flows — unchanged until clone QA is complete
• Twilio SMS campaigns — paused pending post-Google I/O media strategy review`,

THE "DYSON MEDIA DESK" — REPLACING A $90K/YEAR PR FIRM WITH A $500/MONTH AI STACK

────────────────────────────────
THE CORE CONCEPT: TWO-CHARACTER INTERVIEW FORMAT
────────────────────────────────
Instead of Bob appearing as a solo monologue on every piece of content (which risks "overkill"), we create a two-character Dialogue format. Psychology calls this the "Social Proof" model — when people eavesdrop on an expert conversation, engagement increases dramatically compared to a standard pitch.

CHARACTER 1 — THE INTERVIEWER ("The Journalist")
• A distinct persona — NOT Bob. Think "Global Relocation Reporter" or "Tech Correspondent"
• Voice: Google Gemini 3.1 Flash Live API — pre-built native voice (e.g. "Puck" or "Charon") — professional, inquisitive, punchy (60 Minutes / NPR style)
• Visual: AI-generated headshot via Midjourney/DALL-E — professional journalist appearance
• Role: Asks the "hard questions" clients are actually thinking ("What happens to my utility deposits when I move through Dyson Relo?")
• The Anchor: Stays consistent across all content. They are the face of "Dyson News."

CHARACTER 2 — THE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT (Bob Dyson)
• Bob's Personal Clone — Google Gemini Native Voice Clone (clearing beta — deploy immediately upon GA release)
• Role: Provides visionary answers. The expert who simplified the 8-step relocation process.
• Appears only for "Visionary Insight" — not on every page
• The Dynamic: Creates a "ping-pong" effect. 5-minute explainer feels like 2 minutes.

────────────────────────────────
PRODUCTION WORKFLOW
────────────────────────────────
1. SCRIPT (Gemini): "Write a 2-minute interview about the Dyson Home utility connection process." Gemini writes BOTH parts — interviewer questions AND expert answers.

2. VOICE (Gemini 3.1 Flash Live API): Two distinct native voices — one for the Journalist (e.g. "Puck"), one for Bob's clone (Google Native Voice Clone, pending GA). Audio streamed via Google's native WebSocket audio stream — no third-party voice API required.

3. VISUAL (HeyGen or D-ID): Two "talking photo" avatars. Layout: side-by-side bubbles OR flip-flop like a televised news segment.

4. BACKGROUND (Gemini Image Gen + Veo): 
   • Static: "A high-end modern real estate executive office in a San Diego skyscraper, sunset lighting, cinematic depth of field"
   • Dynamic: Use Veo for subtle motion — dust motes, city traffic through the window, flickering screen — 5–10 second loop

────────────────────────────────
THE DNN DAILY FORMAT (BASE44 AUTOMATION)
────────────────────────────────
Morning News Segment:
• The "Journalist" clone introduces the daily real estate headline
• Bob's clone comes on to explain how that news affects Dyson Relo clients
• The segment is auto-generated from DNN's daily article feed

This creates a "Variety Show" format — not a "One-Man Show." It feels like a production, not a lecture.

────────────────────────────────
WHERE EACH FORMAT IS USED
────────────────────────────────
Internal App (The 8 Steps): "Personal Concierge" approach — just Bob, small bubble, helpful and brief. 15–30 seconds max.

External Marketing/PR: "Two-Character Interview" — used for Big Picture concepts. Explaining the WHY and HOW of Dyson Relo to press and new audiences.

Press Releases / Media Outreach: Send as a "Ready-to-Air" Video News Release (VNR). TV stations and news blogs can literally take the Journalist's questions out, have their anchor read them, then play Bob's cloned response. VNR on steroids.

────────────────────────────────
THE FULL DISTRIBUTION STACK (REPLACING THE $7,500/MO QUOTE)
────────────────────────────────
Channel                    | Tool                          | Est. Monthly Cost
---------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------
Voice Synthesis            | Gemini 3.1 Flash Live (native)| ~$0 (API usage)
Voice Clone (Bob)          | Google Native Voice Clone     | TBD on GA pricing
Direct Media (PR Wire)     | Newsworthy.ai or Prowly.com   | $300–$500
Social Media (Auto-Post)   | Metricool or Buffer           | $20–$50
SMS (Targeted Lists)       | Twilio (pay-per-message)      | ~$0.01/text
Email / Newsletter         | Beehiiv or Mailchimp          | $0–$100
Video Avatar               | HeyGen or Synthesia           | $50–$150/mo
Workflow Automation        | Make.com                      | ~$30/mo

TOTAL ESTIMATED TECH SPEND: $400–$800/month
vs. $7,500/month quote = SAVINGS OF OVER $80,000/YEAR
Note: ElevenLabs explicitly removed from stack. All voice runs natively through Gemini.

────────────────────────────────
AUTOMATED CAMPAIGN WORKFLOW
────────────────────────────────
1. Gemini writes the script and Interviewer questions
2. Gemini 3.1 Flash Live API generates both voices via native WebSocket audio stream (Journalist: pre-built voice / Bob: Native Voice Clone on GA)
3. HeyGen renders both talking-photo avatars using Gemini-generated audio as lip-sync input, with Gemini-generated background
4. Base44 automation pushes:
   → To Social: YouTube / Instagram / LinkedIn (auto-upload via Make.com)
   → To Press: Video link + Gemini-written press release sent via Newsworthy.ai → Google News + industry wires
   → To Clients: Twilio SMS to targeted leads: "Check out our latest update on relocation trends" + link

────────────────────────────────
BACKEND ARCHITECTURE — GEMINI 3.1 FLASH LIVE API (NATIVE, NO ELEVENLABS)
────────────────────────────────
DECISION: We are deploying exclusively on Google's native Gemini 3.1 Flash Live API.
ElevenLabs is explicitly NOT used. All voice synthesis runs through Google's native WebSocket audio streams and pre-built voices.

HOW THE AUDIO PIPELINE WORKS:
1. Base44 Deno backend function opens a persistent WebSocket connection to the Gemini Live API endpoint:
   wss://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/ws/google.ai.generativelanguage.v1beta.GenerativeService.BidiGenerateContent

2. The script for each character (Journalist + Bob clone) is segmented into turn-based chunks and sent as text input over the WebSocket.

3. Gemini streams back raw PCM audio chunks in real-time using the configured native voice per character:
   • Journalist character → assigned a pre-built Gemini voice (e.g. "Puck", "Charon", "Fenrir", "Aoede")
   • Bob Dyson clone → Google Native Voice Clone (production deployment pending GA clearance of beta; drop-in replacement requires no architecture change — same WebSocket, same stream, different voiceName parameter)

4. The Base44 backend function buffers the audio stream, assembles the final audio file, and stores it via UploadFile integration → returns the file_url for use in HeyGen avatar rendering or direct playback.

VOICE CLONE READINESS:
The architecture is intentionally designed so that when Google Native Voice Clone exits beta, the ONLY required change is swapping the voiceName parameter from a pre-built voice to Bob's registered clone ID. The entire WebSocket stream, audio assembly, and downstream HeyGen pipeline remain unchanged. Zero re-architecture required.

BASE44 EXECUTION CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT
────────────────────────────────
✅ FULLY EXECUTABLE ON BASE44 (NATIVE GEMINI STACK):
• DNN daily article generation (Gemini API — already live)
• Script writing for both characters (Gemini InvokeLLM — trivial addition)
• Journalist voice synthesis (Gemini 3.1 Flash Live — native WebSocket stream, Deno backend function)
• Bob Dyson voice clone (Gemini Native Voice Clone — deploy on GA; same backend, swap voiceName)
• SMS distribution to targeted lists (Twilio — already live)
• Email blasting to subscriber tiers (SendEmail integration — already live)
• Campaign orchestration and scheduling (Base44 automations — already live)
• Subscriber CRM tagging and segmentation (DnnSubscriber entity — already live)
• Social post content generation (Gemini — can add SocialPost entity workflow)

🔧 REQUIRES EXTERNAL INTEGRATION (NOT NATIVE TO BASE44):
• HeyGen / D-ID video rendering — requires HeyGen API key + webhook handler (voice audio fed IN from Gemini output)
• Newsworthy.ai / Prowly PR distribution — requires account + API
• Veo video background generation — requires Google Veo API access (waitlist)
• Metricool / Buffer social auto-posting — requires OAuth connector or Make.com bridge

📋 RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS:
1. Build geminiVoiceStream Deno backend function — opens Gemini 3.1 Flash Live WebSocket, sends script text, buffers PCM audio output, uploads assembled audio file via UploadFile, returns file_url
2. Get HeyGen API key → build backend function to submit avatar video jobs using Gemini-generated audio as lip-sync input
3. Connect Make.com to Base44 webhook → automate social posting from DNN article publish event
4. Register Newsworthy.ai account → trigger PR blast when article status = "blasted"
5. Produce first "Test Interview" using Bob headshot + generated Journalist headshot + Gemini native audio
6. On Google Voice Clone GA → register Bob's voice, update voiceName in geminiVoiceStream function — done`,

    content: `LOOK B EXPANDED: THE GLOBAL MARKET AUTHORITY (AVIATION ASSETS)
Entry Date: May 16, 2026

These assets will be used as b-roll, transitions, and video intro hooks whenever Bob is delivering heavy-hitting national real estate metrics or international residential market updates. Integrating private aviation doesn't just show how you travel — it visually validates 54+ years of scale, the background as a former Chief Pilot, and the absolute reality of how high-end residential relocation actually moves. It instantly separates Dyson & Dyson from a typical local real estate agent and frames Bob as a global logistics mastermind who can deploy anywhere at a moment's notice.

────────────────────────────────
ASSET B-1: THE PRE-FLIGHT DEPARTURE (ENTERING THE SCENE)
────────────────────────────────
VISUAL PROMPT:
"A cinematic, sharp corporate media shot of Bob Dyson walking purposefully across a sun-drenched private tarmac in San Diego County toward a sleek, modern private luxury jet. He possesses his signature broad, dignified build and perfectly groomed silver hair, looking sharp and authoritative. He is wearing his custom-tailored dark charcoal executive suit, a crisp white dress shirt, and a solid burgundy silk tie. He carries a premium leather briefcase in one hand, captured mid-stride with a confident, focused expression. The background shows the gleaming fuselage of the aircraft with clean reflections, softly blurred for an elite depth of field."

STRATEGIC MESSAGE:
Ultimate execution. It tells the viewer that a high-end relocation doesn't wait around for commercial flight schedules — your operation moves with absolute speed.

USE CASE: Opening hook for national market update videos. Transition into DNN daily briefings.

────────────────────────────────
ASSET B-2: THE IN-TRANSIT COMMAND (ON-LOCATION STRATEGY)
────────────────────────────────
VISUAL PROMPT:
"A high-end, interior lifestyle shot of Bob Dyson seated comfortably inside the cabin of a luxurious private jet in mid-flight. He is looking out the window thoughtfully or reviewing real estate market metrics on a sleek digital tablet. He is in his sharp grey broadcast suit and burgundy tie, embodying complete financial competence and high-tech command. Natural daylight streams through the cabin windows, illuminating the premium wood and leather interior. Crisp, cinematic editorial lighting."

STRATEGIC MESSAGE:
You are managing the global network in real-time, matching the high-tech capabilities built right into the DysonRelo Base44 Workspace.

USE CASE: B-roll for "managing your move remotely" content. Mid-video transition between market data segments.

────────────────────────────────
ASSET B-3: THE ARRIVAL / OUT-OF-AREA DEPLOYMENT (LEAVING THE SCENE)
────────────────────────────────
VISUAL PROMPT:
"An authoritative, cinematic exterior shot of Bob Dyson stepping out of a private aircraft onto a pristine tarmac at an out-of-state or international airport. He is adjusting his grey suit jacket, looking out at the destination skyline with an open, confident smile. The scene represents executive movement and global real estate capability, completely avoiding generic corporate stock imagery in favor of a clean, premium, high-integrity lifestyle environment."

STRATEGIC MESSAGE:
Global reach. Whether a client is moving a high-end estate into or out of North County, you have the boots-on-the-ground capability to oversee the transition.

USE CASE: Intro for out-of-area market reports. Agent recruitment videos. Corporate relocation pitch decks.

────────────────────────────────
HOW THIS INTEGRATES WITH THE 21 AI ASSISTANTS
────────────────────────────────
This aviation layer fits perfectly with the infrastructure documented in the corporate layout. While the 21 AI Assistants live on DysonHomes.com automate the friction of utility connections, document tracking, and escrow milestones behind the scenes — these private aviation visuals tell the client WHY Bob has that time: because the technology gives him the freedom to live, work, and dominate the high-end luxury lifestyle he represents.

The message is: "The machine handles the details. Bob handles the vision."

────────────────────────────────
STAGING THE DESKTOP FOLDER
────────────────────────────────
Copy the three prompts above into a text file and drop it directly into your CLONE ASSETS folder next to your master headshots.

File naming convention:
• bob_dyson_B1_preflight_departure_prompt.txt
• bob_dyson_B2_intransit_command_prompt.txt
• bob_dyson_B3_arrival_deployment_prompt.txt

────────────────────────────────
NEXT STEP: SCRIPT TRANSITION FORMULA
────────────────────────────────
Recommended next build: Map out the exact script formula for transitioning from the private jet scene directly into a U.S. financial real estate news update. This creates a signature "arrival hook" — Bob steps off the plane, looks at the camera, and delivers the week's most important relocation market data. That segment becomes the flagship format for DNN's weekly broadcast.`,

    id: 'top200-agent-campaign',
    title: '🎯 Top 200 Independent Agent Campaign',
    icon: Users,
    content: `ENTRY DATE: May 18, 2026

THE STRATEGY: SELECTIVE EXECUTIVE INVITATION — NOT MASS MARKETING
────────────────────────────────
We have pulled 2025 production numbers on 200 top-performing independent agents from across the country using Gemini research. These are NOT big-box brokerage agents (no Compass, no Coldwell Banker, no Keller Williams). These are elite boutique and independent operators who pride themselves on agility, high-end service, and freedom from corporate bureaucracy.

This is a two-way pitch:
1. WE WANT THEM as our exclusive regional buyer lead partners — sending our relocation buyer leads to them in their markets.
2. WE WANT THEM to send US their referrals — clients relocating out of their market who need a full-service concierge to manage the move, stay in the loop, and close the deal.

────────────────────────────────
WHY INDEPENDENT AGENTS — NOT BIG-BOX
────────────────────────────────
Big-box brokerages (Compass, Coldwell Banker, etc.) force agents and clients into rigid, in-house corporate relocation software. Independent agents have no such constraint. They can partner freely and they are actively looking for elite alternatives that match their brand standard.

By leading with Bob's 55-year legacy, the HOMES Ecosystem, and the AI-managed relocation process, we speak their exact language: independence, quality, accountability, and real results.

────────────────────────────────
EXECUTION PLATFORM: SIMPLETEXTING.COM
────────────────────────────────
Because these are high-value top producers — NOT mass SMS targets — the campaign runs through SimpleTexting.com, NOT Twilio batch blasts. SimpleTexting allows direct 1-on-1 reply management from a clean inbox, protecting sender reputation and enabling real conversations with decision-makers.

Export the 200-agent list from Base44 (VettedPartner entity, market_type=destination, status=active/pending) and upload as a dedicated segment in SimpleTexting.

────────────────────────────────
STEP 1 — THE SELECTIVE HOOK (NO LINKS IN FIRST MESSAGE)
────────────────────────────────
Script:
"Hi [Agent Name], saw your impressive 2025 production numbers with [Brokerage Name]. We're selectively reaching out to top independent agents outside the big-box firms to act as our exclusive regional partner for incoming relocation buyer leads in [City]. Are you currently accepting new corporate referral clients?"

Why it works:
• Personalized — references their specific 2025 production and brokerage
• Positions this as an exclusive territory offer, not a mass pitch
• No link = no carrier filtering, no spam flags
• Opens with a yes/no question that invites a reply

────────────────────────────────
STEP 2 — THE VALUE-ADD REPLY (AFTER THEY ENGAGE)
────────────────────────────────
Once they reply with interest, carriers freely pass links because it is now a two-way conversation.

Script:
"Fantastic. Unlike standard hand-off networks, we manage the entire logistics pipeline alongside you — all the way to closing. You can review our client process map and AI assistant platform here: [Link to App/AIAssistants]. Our platform keeps you permanently in the loop with live escrow and sale milestones for every client you refer to us. We'd love your thoughts on this model."

────────────────────────────────
THREE STRATEGIC PILLARS FOR THE PITCH
────────────────────────────────
1. THE ANTI-BIG-BOX ALLIANCE
"We're built for independent operators like you — not for corporate in-house relocation software. We protect your local brand autonomy while delivering a white-glove concierge process your clients will rave about."

2. THE CO-PILOT ESCROW PROMISE
"Most relocation networks take 35% and disappear. We stay in every escrow alongside you. Our workspace keeps you copied on every relocation task, utility transition, and milestone — from day one through close. We absorb the moving stress so you can focus purely on the transaction."

3. CAMERA-READY VALIDATION (COMING SOON)
"As we roll out our Gemini-powered video news capabilities, this agent group will be among the first to receive personalized video market updates co-branded for their territory."

────────────────────────────────
WHAT AGENTS GET BY PARTNERING WITH DYSON & DYSON
────────────────────────────────
• Exclusive territory buyer leads from our national relocation marketing
• Live escrow and milestone visibility in the Dyson platform — always in the loop
• Zero added workload — we handle 100% of the relocation logistics
• 25% referral fee at close on any buyer we send their way
• Co-branded DNN intelligence content for their farm (Bureau Chief tier)
• Their clients return after the move and refer them friends

────────────────────────────────
WHAT WE GET FROM SENDING AGENTS
────────────────────────────────
• Inbound referrals — their clients relocating OUT of market
• 25% referral fee from the receiving agent at destination close
• 10–15% relocation management fee from the seller at close of their current home
• Expanded national network — every agent who sends becomes a flywheel node

────────────────────────────────
NEXT STEPS
────────────────────────────────
1. Export 200-agent list from Base44 VettedPartner entity
2. Upload to SimpleTexting as dedicated "Top Independent Agents" segment
3. Personalize Step 1 script with each agent's name, brokerage, and city
4. Launch initial outreach — monitor replies in SimpleTexting inbox
5. For every interested reply: send Step 2 with app link + process overview
6. Log all responses back into VettedPartner entity (status: contacted → converted)
7. Schedule onboarding call for agents who say yes`,

    content: `Dyson Homes: 2026 Strategic Execution Plan
Founder: Bob Dyson
Core Objective: To leverage 55 years of real estate authority and AI-driven "Professional Information" to disrupt the relocation and residential market.

────────────────────────────────
THE 7-STEP PRODUCTION & DISTRIBUTION ROADMAP
────────────────────────────────

STEP 1 — DIGITAL TWIN CREATION
Finalize AI Clones for Bob (Authority) and a professional Newscaster (Interviewer). Leverage the May 2026 Gemini-Apple "Siri Intelligence" handshake for native device integration.

STEP 2 — CONTENT FORGE
Build a daily pipeline using white-labeled 6:00 AM news. Generate 60-second "Professional Audits" of the news where the Clone-Interviewer grills Bob on the real market impact.

STEP 3 — MULTI-CHANNEL DISTRIBUTION
Automate posting via Base44 to YouTube Shorts, LinkedIn, X, and TikTok. Use these high-reach, free social platforms to maximize reach and bypass SMS carrier restrictions.

STEP 4 — THE CONVERSION LOOP
Every piece of content must end with the Call to Action: "For the professional breakdown and direct access to Bob, download the Dyson Homes App."

STEP 5 — APP ECOSYSTEM
Use the app as the "Master Warehouse" for all segmented content (Consumer, Referral Agent, Active Agent, and Relocation) to ensure high-deliverability via Push Notifications.

STEP 6 — AUTHORITY CONCIERGE
Execute the "High-Value" manual phase: Vetting agents for relocation requests and managing referral activity for the 35,000-strong inactive agent network.

STEP 7 — PROPERTY PROFILING
Deploy automated "Professional Property Audits" within the app. Provide members with veteran-vetted data that corrects generic AVM (Zillow/Redfin) pricing errors.

────────────────────────────────
STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE (THE "MOAT")
────────────────────────────────

THE "COMPASS" COUNTER-MOVE:
While the industry consolidates into corporate "Black Boxes," Dyson Homes provides the "Independent Authority" voice that consumers and independent agents crave.

VOICE-FIRST ARCHITECTURE:
Designed for the 2026 shift toward audio-native interfaces (Siri/Gemini), allowing Bob's authority to reach clients through their devices without friction.

REFERRAL ENGINE:
Monetizing a dormant network of 35,000 California agents by providing them a "System for Life" to generate secondary income with zero overhead.`,

    title: '🎬 3-Shard Automated Video Pipeline',
    icon: Mic,
    content: `PROJECT BRIEF: 3-SHARD AUTOMATED VIDEO PIPELINE
Entry Date: June 4, 2026
Stack: Base44 ➔ Make.com ➔ HeyGen

OBJECTIVE:
Automate a zero-human-intervention video production pipeline that triggers when content is published in Base44 and generates programmatic video variants in HeyGen. Three content formats ("shards") are produced automatically from a single content event.

────────────────────────────────
THE STACK
────────────────────────────────
• Trigger: Base44 webhook/API payload when a daily article or script goes live
• Middleware / Logic: Make.com using custom Webhooks, Routers, and JSON parsers
• AI Processing: OpenAI API (gpt-4o) for converting written text into spoken, conversational broadcast scripts
• Video Generation: HeyGen API v2 — custom Instant Avatar clones and multi-scene pre-saved Templates

────────────────────────────────
🔹 SHARD 1: DAILY NEWS (SOLO CHARLIE)
────────────────────────────────
Input: Raw text payload from morning news generation.

Logic: OpenAI filters out non-spoken syntax, constrains data to natural dialogue (under 60 words per segment), and formats it into a clean speech string.

Action: Make.com pushes the script to a saved HeyGen template using the Charlie Avatar Clone ID.

────────────────────────────────
🔹 SHARD 2: SITE EDUCATION (SOLO CHARLIE WALKTHROUGH)
────────────────────────────────
Input: Core article/product feature text.

Logic: Sent directly without dense rewriting to maintain instructional accuracy.

Action: Triggers a solo Charlie Avatar render to act as an on-screen guide.

────────────────────────────────
🔹 SHARD 3: PREMIUM INTERVIEW (THE "DONUT" TEMPLATE)
────────────────────────────────
Input: Article or script payload containing structured dialogue fields.

Logic: OpenAI structures the text into a strict JSON array of { speaker: "charlie" | "bob", text: "..." } variables.

Action: Make.com targets a 3-Scene HeyGen Template:
• Scene 1 (Intro): Pre-rendered or dynamically voiced Charlie Anchor intro
• Scene 2 (The Core): Injects the dynamic Bob Dyson Avatar Clone ID script variable
• Scene 3 (Outro): Pre-rendered Charlie call-to-action outro

────────────────────────────────
⚠️ CRITICAL TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS
────────────────────────────────

ASYNC POLLING & WEBHOOK LOOP:
HeyGen video renders take 3–15 minutes. The Make.com scenario must NOT hold a synchronous HTTP request open. Architecture must split into:
• Scenario A: Triggers the render job and logs the HeyGen video_id to the DnnArticle entity
• Scenario B: Uses HeyGen's video_completed webhook (or a delayed polling loop) to fetch the final asset once ready and update the article's video_url field in Base44

CORS HANDLING & CROSS-ORIGIN VIDEO:
HeyGen's direct AWS storage URLs (files2.heygen.ai) frequently trigger strict browser CORS restrictions when embedded natively in HTML5 <video> elements. The engineer must configure the pipeline to capture BOTH:
• The raw .mp4 file URL (for download/archive)
• The clean responsive https://app.heygen.com/embeds/[video_id] iframe target (for seamless Base44 front-end embedding)

STRICT AVATAR KEY VALIDATION:
The application requires variables mapped to custom premium clones (is_custom: true, is_public: false). The engineer must write a robust validation step with fallback paths — e.g., routing to a designated stock avatar library ID like "Adrian in Blue Suit" if a specific custom clone ID returns unassigned.

────────────────────────────────
ENGINEER DELIVERABLES
────────────────────────────────
1. A fully operational, thoroughly tested Make.com blueprint (.json export) with clean routing logical blocks

2. Systematic error-handling pathways for failed API calls or malformed JSON script structures

3. A clean automated payload delivery back to Base44 to update the corresponding article's video_url or embed_id live on the dashboard

────────────────────────────────
BASE44 INTEGRATION POINTS (FOR THE ENGINEER)
────────────────────────────────
• Trigger Source: DnnArticle entity — status changes to "published" fire the Base44 webhook
• article_id, headline, body, interview_qa (structured Q&A array for Shard 3), trigger_type
• Return Target: DnnArticle.video_url (embed URL) and/or DnnArticle.audio_url fields
• Existing HeyGen functions in Base44: heygenRenderVideo, heygenCheckVideo, heygenRenderWithAudio, heygenListAvatars
• The heygenCheckVideo function already polls status and updates video_url on completion — Make.com Scenario B can call this endpoint or mirror this pattern directly

────────────────────────────────
STATUS
────────────────────────────────
⏳ PENDING — Engineer recruitment in progress. Current DNN article automation and media plan continue running uninterrupted. This pipeline is additive — no changes to existing flows until the Make.com blueprint is tested and approved.`,

    content: `ENTRY DATE: July 14, 2026

HEYGEN VIDEO PRODUCTION COST STRATEGY — EVERGREEN LIBRARY + COMBINED RENDERS

────────────────────────────────
THE PROBLEM
────────────────────────────────
Each Q&A segment was rendered as TWO separate HeyGen clips: Charlie asks (1 render) + Bob answers (1 render). A single show with 6 Q&A pairs = 14 renders. Two daily shows = 28 renders/day. At ~15-20 seconds per clip, that's 7-10 minutes of fresh video daily. HeyGen bills per second. This was running ~$100/day = ~$3,000/month in ongoing production costs — before any new content was added.

The deeper issue: most Q&A content is evergreen. "What does a relocation manager do?" doesn't change Monday vs. Wednesday. We were re-rendering identical conceptual content repeatedly, burning credits on videos that already existed.

────────────────────────────────
THE THREE-TIER COST STRATEGY
────────────────────────────────

TIER 1 — EVERGREEN LIBRARY (Render Once, Reuse Forever)
All Q&A clips explaining core concepts (DNN model, relocation process, PRN, corporate relo, etc.) are rendered exactly once. The frontend assembles them into shows from the library. Cost: $0/day for evergreen content.

• Vetting Desk, Corporate Relo, Roadmap, Real Estate Answers, Receiving Agent — all evergreen
• Standardized opens (Charlie intros) and closes (Charlie outros) rendered once per show
• Bullet-point overlays and dynamic backgrounds handled on the frontend (no HeyGen cost)
• Only re-render if the script itself changes substantively — never for aesthetic tweaks

TIER 2 — FRONTEND-ASSEMBLED DAILY SHOWS (Near-Zero Cost)
Daily shows assemble from: pre-rendered Charlie intros/outros (evergreen) + Bob's pre-rendered evergreen clips + frontend-generated bullet points for the day's actual news content. The only HeyGen cost is if a genuinely new clip is needed that doesn't exist in the library.

• Bob's segments use the off-white bullet-point overlay system (already built in DnnNewsBroadcastPlayer)
• Background swaps, bullet extraction, and chyron text are all frontend-driven
• Zero HeyGen credits consumed for daily assembled shows

TIER 3 — FULL FRESH VIDEO RENDER (Rare, Breaking Content Only)
Reserve full dual-character video renders for genuinely new, high-value content — 2-3 times per week maximum, not daily. Everything else assembles from the library.

────────────────────────────────
COMBINED RENDER CONSOLIDATION
────────────────────────────────
IMPLEMENTED: Charlie's question + Bob's answer are now combined into a SINGLE HeyGen API call using multiple video_inputs. One render job, one video file, one credit charge — instead of two.

BEFORE: 6 Q&A pairs × 2 clips each = 12 renders per show
AFTER: 6 Q&A pairs × 1 combined clip each = 6 renders per show (50% reduction)

This is the standard for ALL Q&A render pipelines going forward:
• corporateReloQARender
• realEstateQARender
• vettingDeskQARender
• lenderRender
• solveMyStoryRender
• roadmapQARender
• receivingAgentQARender
• dnnNewsRender
• portalLeadInRender

New entity fields: combinedHeygenId, combinedVideoUrl, combinedStatus
New actions: startCombined, checkCombined, startAllCombined

────────────────────────────────
COST PROJECTION
────────────────────────────────
BEFORE (Pre-Optimization):
• ~28 renders/day × 7 days = ~196 renders/week
• Estimated cost: ~$100/day = ~$3,000/month

AFTER (Post-Optimization):
• Evergreen library: $0/day (rendered once, reused forever)
• Daily assembled shows: $0/day (frontend-driven)
• Fresh full renders: ~6 renders/week (Tier 3 breaking content only)
• Estimated cost: ~$5-10/day = ~$150-300/month

RESULT: ~90-97% reduction in ongoing HeyGen production costs.
The $1,000 initial setup expense for new video/voice product development is expected and budgeted. The ongoing daily/monthly fees are now minimized through the evergreen library + combined render approach.

────────────────────────────────
PRODUCTION RULES (ENFORCED GOING FORWARD)
────────────────────────────────
1. NEVER re-render an evergreen clip for aesthetic changes. Use frontend overlays.
2. ALWAYS use combined rendering for new Q&A pairs (one API call, not two).
3. Standardized opens/closes are rendered once and reused across all shows of the same type.
4. Script changes require admin approval before any re-render is triggered.
5. HeyGen quota is monitored daily. Production pauses automatically when credits are low.`

    title: 'Key Risks & Mitigations',
    icon: Shield,
    content: `Risk 1: Agent Network Adoption
  Mitigation: Aggressive recruitment incentives, proven referral quality, white-glove onboarding

  Risk 2: Data Dependency on Third Parties (Zillow, MLS)
  Mitigation: Build proprietary data layer; negotiate direct MLS partnerships; develop alternatives

  Risk 3: LLM API Costs at Scale
  Mitigation: Cache queries; batch processing; transition to custom models; negotiate volume discounts

  Risk 4: Regulatory (State real estate licensing, referral fee structures)
  Mitigation: Legal review by state; structured as agent networking platform, not brokerage

  Risk 5: Competitive Response from Zillow/Redfin
  Mitigation: Premium positioning + network effects make them slow to respond; build moat via data + brand

  Risk 6: Churn if Agent Experience is Poor
  Mitigation: Excellent referral quality data; dedicated agent success team; ongoing feedback loop`

CONSUMER SCRIPT (CHARLIE'S INTRO)
────────────────────────────────
"I've prepared a private V2V session with Gemini—our most advanced advisor. To protect this premium experience, please confirm your Dyson Network commitment below to start your 10-minute deep-dive."

Purpose: Frames the Gemini Live session as an exclusive, premium benefit that requires commitment.

────────────────────────────────
AGENT SCRIPT (THE THREE-WAY)
────────────────────────────────
"I've brought Gemini into our call to analyze the data. Gemini, based on the new listing Sarah liked, how does the commute change compared to her original plan?"

Purpose: Introduces the Silent Moderator mode—Gemini is listening to agent-client conversations and detecting pivot points in real-time.

────────────────────────────────
POST-SESSION EXECUTION: DELTA REPORT
────────────────────────────────
After every voice session, the system automatically:

1. GENERATES: Delta Report — compares session data to baseline moving plan, extracts all detected pivot points

2. EMAILS BUYER: "Your Relocation Profile Updated" — highlights changes, confirms updated priorities/timeline/budget, links to updated Moving Plan dashboard

3. EMAILS AGENT: "[BUYER NAME] – Relocation Profile Update" — agent-focused summary of changes, actionable next steps

4. UPDATES SYSTEM: Moving Plan entity — all detected pivots logged to pivot_points array with timestamps and source tags

STRATEGIC VALUE:
✓ Keeps both parties informed with minimal admin overhead
✓ Surfaces real changes in buyer preferences as they happen
✓ Gives agents actionable intelligence for next conversation
✓ Creates system of record for all preference changes`

          <p>Business Plan v8.0 • Last Updated: July 14, 2026 • NEW: HeyGen Production Cost Optimization — Three-tier strategy (Evergreen Library + Frontend-Assembled Shows + Rare Fresh Renders). Combined render consolidation: Charlie's question + Bob's answer now rendered as ONE HeyGen API call instead of two (50% render reduction). Ongoing production costs reduced from ~$100/day to ~$5-10/day. Evergreen clips rendered once and reused forever. Standardized opens/closes rendered once per show type. Frontend overlays handle all aesthetic changes at zero HeyGen cost. Previously v7.0 • 3-Shard Automated Video Pipeline (Base44 ➔ Make.com ➔ HeyGen) — Shard 1 (Daily News, Solo Charlie), Shard 2 (Site Education, Solo Charlie Walkthrough), Shard 3 (Premium Interview, "Donut" 3-Scene Template). Critical constraints documented: async polling architecture, CORS/embed handling, avatar key validation with fallback paths. Engineer deliverables defined. Existing media plan continues uninterrupted. Previously v6.5 • DECISIONS LOGGED TODAY: (1) Twilio remains fully intact — zero changes. All automated homeowner SMS, opt-in/opt-out processing, and batch outreach continue running on Twilio. (2) SimpleTexting.com reinstated — used exclusively for the Top 200 Independent Agent outreach campaign, managed manually outside the app. No app integration at this time. (3) Gemini 3.1 Flash Live API deployment begins post-Google I/O May 19 — full voice-to-voice upgrade path confirmed; all voice synthesis native to Google, ElevenLabs permanently off the stack. Previously v6.4: Added: Top 200 Independent Agent Campaign — SimpleTexting 2-step outreach strategy, anti-big-box positioning, co-pilot escrow promise, exclusive territory pitch. Previously v6.3: Added: Clone Deployment Roadmap — Journalist clone + Bob Dyson personal clone for DNN video feed; Charlie kept, upgraded to Bob's voice, and renamed post-QA. Previously v6.2: Added: Google I/O May 19 Gemini 3.1 Flash Live upgrade path — voice-to-text → voice-to-voice migration plan. Previously v6.1: Updated: Backend architecture rewritten — ElevenLabs removed, all voice synthesis now runs natively on Gemini 3.1 Flash Live API (WebSocket audio streams + pre-built voices). Google Native Voice Clone (Bob Dyson) to deploy on GA. Zero re-architecture required on clone release. Previously v6.0 (May 16): Dyson Media Desk — Two-Character Interview Strategy, Virtual Newsroom, Aviation Asset Library. v5.0: Landing Page Transition Plan (April 2026) • DNN Broadcast Intelligence Network (March 2026)</p>
